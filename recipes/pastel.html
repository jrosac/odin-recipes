            <li>All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>Egg, yolk only</li>
            <li>Butter</li>

        <h2>Steps :</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Step 1:</p>
                <p>The dough is only a few ingredients and very easy. You can make the dough in advance and keep it in plastic wrap for up to 2 days.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Step 2:</p>
                <p>Add the salt to the water and set aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Step 3:</p>
                <p>Sift the flour into a large bowl or flat surface. Make a well in the center and add the egg yolk and softened butter. Tip: I like to cut the butter into small pieces and then let it come to room temperature to soften.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Step 4:</p>
                <p>Using a fork, combine the flour with the egg yolk and butter.</p>            
            </li>
            <li><p>Step 5:</p>
                <p>Add the salted water and continue to mix until it starts to pull away from the sides and stick together. Then switch from fork to hands and knead (in the bowl or lightly floured work surface) until the pastry is elastic, about 4-5 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Step 6:</p>
                <p>Let the dough rest for 1 hour, covered with a cloth or plastic wrap. If longer than an hour, wrap in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.</p>
